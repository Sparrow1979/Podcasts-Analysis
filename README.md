Project name: Podcast Reviews Analysis

Description: The goal of the analysis if threefold:

I will make a short general review of the database by analyzing its structure and data. The goal of this part is to get a general sense of what story the data is trying to tell us.

In the second part of the analysis, I will perform a number of statistical analysis. The goal is to:

a) Idenftify the patterns in the podcast reviews.

b) Define at least two possbile samples for comparison analysis.

c) Perform statistical analysis of the chosen samples.

d) Visualize the findings with SNS and Google Data studio.
